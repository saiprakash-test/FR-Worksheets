10. What is the difference between a boxplot and histogram?
Answer: A histogram is a type of bar chart that graphically displays the frequencies of a data set.A histogram plots the frequency on the Y-axis and variable to be measured on the X-axis.
A boxplot is a chart that graphically represents the five most important descriptive values for a data set.These values include the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. 

A histogram is preferable over a box plot is when there is very little variance among the observed frequencies.A box plot allows to compare multiple data sets better than histograms as they are less detailed and take up less space.

11. How to select metrics?
Answer: The metrics used in Clasiification problem are:
Confusion matrix
Type I Error
Type II Error
Accuracy
Recall
Precision
Specificity
F1 Score
ROC Curve-AUC Score
PR Curve
Generally Accuracy,F1 score and ROC Curve-AUC Score are chosen best metrics for the classification problem.

The metrics used in Regression problem are:
Mean Squared Error
Root Mean Squared Error
Mean Absolute Error
R-Squared
Generally R-Squared is chosen best metrics for the regression problem.

12. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
Answer:
==> Creating a null hypothesis.
==> Creating an alternative hypothesis.
==> Determining the significance level.
==> Deciding on the type of test we use.
==> Performing a power analysis to find out the sample size.
==> Calculating the standard deviation.
==> Using the standard error formula.
==> Determining the t-score.
==> Finding the degrees of freedom.
==> Using a t-table.

13. Give examples of data that doesnot have a Gaussian distribution, nor log-normal.
Answer: 
Distribution         Type Data              Examples
Lognormal            Continuous      Cycle or lead time data
Weibull              Continuous      Mean time-to-failure data, time to repair and material strength
Exponential          Continuous      Constant failure rate conditions of products
Poisson              Discrete        Number of events in a specific time period
Binomial             Discrete        Proportion or number of defectives

14. Give an example where the median is a better measure than the mean.
Answer: Mean is sensitive to outliers. 
For example, we have the following data:  1,2,3,4,5
Mean = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3
Median = Middle value = 3
Here the mean and median are same. When an outlier is added to the same data.
Data : 1,2,3,4,5,100
Mean = (1+2+3+4+5+100)/6 = 19.16
Median = Middle value = Mean of middle values =(3+4)/2 = 3.5
So,we can say that median is a better measure because median is not much effected to the added outlier.

15. What is the Likelihood?
Answer:Likelihood refers to finding the best distribution of the data given a particular value of some feature or some situation in the data.Likelihood function measures the goodness of fit of a statistical model to a sample of data for given values of the unknown parameters.
