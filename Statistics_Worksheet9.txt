4. A hypothesis test is used to prevent a machine from under filling or overfilling quart bottles of beer. On the basis of sample, the machine is shut down for inspection. A thorough examination reveals there is nothing wrong with the filling machine. From a statistical point of view: 
a. Both Type I and Type II errors were made. 
b. A Type I error was made.

7. A bottling company needs to produce bottles that will hold 12 ounces of liquid. Periodically, the company gets complaints that their bottles are not holding enough liquid. To test this claim, the bottling company randomly samples 36 bottles. Suppose the p-value of this test turned out to be 0.0455. State the proper conclusion. 
a. At α = 0.085, fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
b. At α = 0.035, accept the null hypothesis.

a. 0.750 
b. 0.375 
c. 0.1885

Answer: b. 0.375

13.What is T distribution and Z distribution?
Answer:The T distribution is a hypothetical probability distribution. It is also known as the student’s t-distribution. It is used to make presumptions about a mean when the standard deviation is not known to us. It is symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution, similar to the standard normal curve. 

The Z-distribution is a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 1. Values on the Z-distribution are called z-values, z-scores, or standard scores. A z-value represents the number of standard deviations that a particular value lies above or below the mean.

14.Is the T distribution normal?
Answer:The t-distribution is similar to a normal distribution but it has heavier tails, which means it tends to produce values that fall far from its mean.

15.What does the T distribution tell us?
Answer: The t distribution is a probability distribution that is used to estimate population parameters when the sample size is small and/or when the population variance is unknown.
The t-distribution is used as an alternative to the normal distribution when sample sizes are small in order to estimate confidence or determine critical values that an observation is a given distance from the mean.
