Answer: Differences between list,tuple,set and dictionary:
List: A list is a mutable, ordered sequence of items. It is represented by []. It allows duplicate elements. It is ordered.It is mutable.

Tuple: Tuples hold together multiple objects. It is represented by (). It allows duplicate elements.It is ordered.It is immutable.

Set: A set is a collection of data which is both unordered and unindexed. It is represented by {}. It doesnot allow duplicate elements.It is unordered.It is mutable.

Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates. It is represented by {}. It doesnot allow duplicate elements.It is ordered.It is mutable.
