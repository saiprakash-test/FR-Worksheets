11. What is denormalization?
Answer: Denormalization is a database optimization technique where we add redundant data in the database to get rid of the complex join operations. This is done to speed up database access speed. Denormalization is done after normalization for improving the performance of the database. The data from one table is included in another table to reduce the number of joins in the query and hence helps in speeding up the performance.Using denormalization query execution is fast since we have to join fewer tables.
