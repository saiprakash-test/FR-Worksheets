11. Which of the following clustering representations and dendrogram depicts the use of MIN or Single link 
proximity function in hierarchical clustering:
Answer: a

12. Which of the following clustering representations and dendrogram depicts the use of MAX or Complete 
link proximity function in hierarchical clustering.
Answer: b

13. What is the importance of clustering?
Answer: Clustering plays an important role to draw insights from unlabeled data. It classifies the data in similar groups which improves various business decisions by providing a meta understanding.
Clustering can also be used for anomaly detection.

14. How can I improve my clustering performance?
Answer: Clustering algorithm can be significantly improved by using a better initialization technique, and by repeating the algorithm.
When the data has overlapping clusters, it can improve the results of the initialization technique.
When the data has well separated clusters, the performance depends completely on the goodness of the initialization.
