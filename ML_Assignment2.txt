13. Is K sensitive to outliers?
Answer: Yes. The k-means algorithm updates the cluster centers by taking the average of all the data points that are closer to each cluster center. When all the points are packed nicely together, the mean makes sense. However, when you have outliers, this can affect the average calculation of the whole cluster. As a result, this will push your cluster center closer to the outlier.

14. Why is K means better?
Answer: K-means is the simplest to implement and run. Easy to understand. Other clustering algorithms with better features tend to be more expensive. In this case, k-means becomes a great solution for pre-clustering, reducing the space into disjoint smaller sub-spaces where other clustering algorithms can be applied.

15. Is K means a deterministic algorithm?
Answer: No, the k-means clustering is based on a non-deterministic algorithm. This means that running the algorithm several times on the same data, could give different results. The non-deterministic nature of K-Means is due to its random selection of data points as initial centroids. The key idea of the algorithm is to select data points which belong to dense regions and which are adequately separated in feature space as the initial centroids.
